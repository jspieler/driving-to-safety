# Driving to Safety
Safety is a crucial aspect for autonomous vehicles. Let's assume that we decide to deploy these systems if they are at least as safe as (comparable) human drivers. But what distance would have to be driven to statistically prove the safety of autonomous vehicles? The authors in [[1]](#1) provide approaches to answering this question. This project implements the calculations and pffers a website where you can explore them interactively.

Spoiler: Simple brute-force testing on public roads is practically not feasible!
